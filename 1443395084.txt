[01:02:08.038] Helen_Croft: !gender needs command
[01:02:12.631] codergoth: !gender
[01:02:12.846] Jens_LN: I think the short black boots would go with the outfit
[01:02:17.792] codergoth: yep no command

[01:03:37.142] LylatPlaysLIVE: imagine putting foundation on your knees XD
[01:03:37.942] Jens_LN: @Jens_LN scars ... also fits with the small tomboy girl trope
[01:03:56.793] hexalao: I have a scar in my arm from a child, it’s like a severely discoloured patch! It’s kinda cool tho
[01:04:17.506] bjorn_egil: pretty typical skater/snowboarder knees then
[01:04:22.084] Jens_LN: scars are like the battlewound of life

[01:05:20.078] Brainfishes: You got a leather jacket? That would go nice.
[01:05:24.265] SuperMinox: need a light jacket
[01:05:25.404] Jens_LN: kinda liked the outfit better without the leggings .. but baby it's cold out there, so I can't fault him for the leggings. :D
[01:05:30.866] NeaW: @Brainfishes same thoughts
[01:05:34.539] sk_eskay: Frick i wish I was this stylish

[01:07:24.596] Jens_LN: I think a dark red on nails might work better ... not sure
[01:07:32.078] AlphasGamingWolf: It’s the tiny top for me
[01:07:34.365] jandraelune: Wigs can get hot. Also the longer your natural hair, the more likely it will peak out from under the wig.
[01:07:35.349] y0rk5h1r3: Fishnet gloves?
[01:07:36.793] NeaW: What time is it over there @Rynali ?

[01:54:21.187] Jens_LN: did you know that the word "Witch" is actually gender-neutral ? ... same with "Warlock" and "Enchanter" ?
[01:54:29.750] c__r__j: To complicate things, witches were actually often intersex in folklore.
[01:54:39.449] phoeberc: Witches were real just magic users of old. The witch image came later
[01:54:52.185] codergoth: @phoeberc yeah this is true

[01:57:27.650] codergoth: @Jens_LN points for credit
[01:57:29.100] phoeberc: Witches were often old (crones). Widows trying to make a living that knew herb remedies and magic. Hence the image grew as witchcraft got worse and worse rap.
[01:57:32.311] lisamaebell: how is girl week going?
[01:57:45.849] Jens_LN: @Jens_LN aw, he didn't fall for it this time. :D

[02:04:14.145] SuperMinox: @codergoth frutchBeeEvil
[02:04:28.338] Jens_LN: On a sidenote, the British eventually went out of their way to end slavery, while everyone else wanted it to go on ... well, most everyone
[02:04:34.561] h_r_buff_n_stuff: true
[02:04:38.151] SuperMinox: @Wezoid they use toblerone as road barriers

[02:05:06.788] snesokk: Yeah, that's why the early Tintin stuff is... not good. After the war Hergé spent his time reforming Tintin and his legacy
[02:05:13.678] phoeberc: And those Liechtensteiners!
[02:05:27.427] Wezoid: the senate did an amazing thing today though
[02:05:42.046] bjorn_egil: most of the time the elections is a choice between two evils, leaving us to try to figure out who will do the least damage

[02:06:15.130] snesokk: @wezoid oh, what did the senate do this time?
[02:06:18.289] Jens_LN: God tried to make Femboys, but failed and made gay people ? ... fail !
[02:06:23.002] BLEIDERjen: if god loves everyone, why isn't everyone in eden because of an x-year old grudge?
[02:06:41.115] toporio7w7: hiii
[02:06:41.845] coldmadness: Don’t forget the Dutch they started the slave trade world with

[02:07:25.516] Jens_LN: Or just plant the tree on the other side of the earth ? ... on top of a mountain ? .. surrounded by a tall fence ?
[02:07:27.538] c__r__j: The WIkipedia article on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil is... long.
[02:07:33.905] anastasia_motionless: dumb killed more people than Satan too
[02:07:34.074] JuicyBoyTV_: Theology researcher over here, fun fact: Lucifer was created due to a mistranslation when an Angel roasts a king calling him Morningstar because he fell from grace.
[02:07:34.874] LylatPlaysLIVE: must not have very much control over it eh?
[02:07:36.490] wandoughtwhaffle: "god you bitch" :D
[02:07:38.166] budzmen420: thing got to boring need to spice  thing up lol
[02:07:39.516] SuperMinox: either not all powerful, or not all knowing or just not real at all

[02:08:02.066] LylatPlaysLIVE: "gods a bitch" T shirts
[02:08:07.334] bill_18436572: nah humans would be like "im gonna climb that mountain to eat that apple"

[02:09:02.882] SuperMinox: wait Lucifer is real - it's on Amazon Prime :D
[02:09:16.005] LylatPlaysLIVE: "god" is just the essence of life and it expects nothing of you
[02:09:18.452] Wezoid: was on netflix
[02:09:34.377] Dex_Carter_: All knowing not all remembering
[02:09:35.430] codergoth: i'd wear the shit out of that lol
[02:09:39.152] Jens_LN: God is a Femboy could land you in trouble, but it's till pretty neat
[02:09:42.390] codergoth: "god is a femboy"
[02:09:46.705] SuperMinox: @codergoth that sounds so sus
[02:10:02.466] Pineapple_Tombstone: Obviously god is gay. Kurt Cobain said so
[02:10:05.808] phoeberc: It is all Babylonian myths anyway
[02:10:08.512] JuicyBoyTV_: There's so much "Non-Canon" biblical scripture that isn't in the bible, so the bible is sooooo broken. Like they don't even explain WHY the flood happened. Like literally why? There's a book called the Book of Enoch which was cut but is the most metal book! It's got Fallen Angels, Giants, and gives shit so much context
[02:10:13.505] codergoth: @Jens_LN idc and i grew up in a heavily religious area
[02:10:14.503] Jens_LN: Actually, since God made EVERYTHING, that also means that he is the root of EVERYTHING .... thus God is the root of all Evil !
[02:10:17.280] Wezoid: what times your party?
[02:10:18.731] Jens_LN: God is evil
[02:10:25.181] Jens_LN: has a ring to it
[02:10:32.125] codergoth: @codergoth what's sus about it?
[02:10:35.220] budzmen420: a few to many drink in the creative stage 👌
[02:10:59.993] phoeberc: Original Sin isn't in the Bible
[02:11:02.629] Jens_LN: yeah, and why wouldn't Moses let the Unicorn come on his boat ?
[02:11:05.339] Wezoid: gods multiverse
[02:11:13.128] dilbertc: in today's news, the pope apologized for their involvement in the canadian residential school system.
[02:11:19.713] SuperMinox: @codergoth "wearing" the "shit" out of something ... - don't know :D
[02:11:38.457] BLEIDERjen: except everyone has their own definition of both canon christianity and christianity legends
[02:11:46.963] Jens_LN: IT MADE THE FROGS GAY !!!
[02:11:52.975] codergoth: @codergoth no i'm not talking about kinks or bodily fluids here lol
[02:11:58.083] phoeberc: Hating gays is cherry picking.
[02:11:59.787] JuicyBoyTV_: Literally not even one mention of homosexuality in that damn book either. Christians just made that shit up
[02:12:04.400] lisamaebell: for a change, read the book of Ezekiel as an ancient aliens story
[02:12:08.679] mzinker: same thing that happened to star wars someone bought it change it to benefit themselves

[02:12:44.583] ben_freeland: i mean the term Christianity is quite general, there's many branches that believe different things.
[02:12:45.123] SuperMinox: @Jens_LN I find it fascinating that that guy didn't had a heart attack yet
[02:12:56.352] phoeberc: It is there in the old testament along with rules for selling your daughters into slavery.
[02:13:02.811] Jens_LN: @Jens_LN he trains his hard with the word of god !  XD
